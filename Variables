// three ways to declare variables in Js
/* var,
   let ,
   const */

//var is basically a legecy declaration for js variables. var used to redeclare the variables which is bad for long LOC.
var myvariable = 10;
var myvariable = 20;
myvariable;
//output  will be 20 

//const is commonly used and good to use in LOC as it makes variables value constant.
const myVariable = 10;
const myvariable 20;
//showing errors

//let is used to re-assign values i.e ++ --
let counter = 0;
counter = counter + 1;
//1
counter++
//2
